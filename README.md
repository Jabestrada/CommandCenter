# CommandCenter
Framework for automating commands that are mostly related to (but not limited to) DevOps tasks

I was motivated to write this framework/application while working with the IT department of one of my remote clients. Their CI/CD infrastructure was at the nascent stages and their deployment procedures, while properly documented, were entirely manual. I figured it was a great opportunity and challenge to build something that will somehow automate the process.
